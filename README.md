# SMR Auto Check-in Plugin for Joomla!

A plugin that automatically checks in articles, menu items, modules and
categories that have been checked out, if the checkout time is older than what
has been specified in the plugin settings.

The check-in is done whenever a user logs in.

This plugin is intended to be used in situations where a significant number of
users either forget to log out or simply close the browser window after editing
an article or other content and no amount of education seems to change that.
